Questions/Tasks to prepare for Session 4 (05.2.24, 11:30)
More Questions for Chapter 03: Material: Chapter 03 A/B video and presentation slides; Exercise->Exercise_part_two.pdf
1) Complete the exercises in Exercise->Exercise_part_two.pdf. Closely inspect the results for different reflection coefficients. Try making the domain longer to better see "wave"-like phenomena.

Questions for Chapter 04 (could also be exam questions):  Material: Chapter 04 A/B video and presentation slides
1) What are additional closure models used to model blood flow in capillaries?
   * 
2) Why are these closure models not needed (or much less relevant) for the artery model?
3) In state-of-the-art empirical models for the effective viscosity, what parameters does the viscosity mainly depend on?
    * Rat death or alive
4) What do we call the phenomenon that effective viscosity changes with blood vessel diameter for small vessels?
   * Fahr√¶us-Effect
5) What are typical data-related challenges for modeling and simulation of blood flow and solute transport in the microcirculation? Name at least one big challenge and some ideas on how to tackle these challenges?
   * Vessels end, where we cut off the domain
   * Data for model validation on different scale
   * Leaky Vessel MMR Signal
