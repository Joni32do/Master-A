PNEUMATIC MODELS:

This submission contains a set of models created with Simulink, Simscape, and Simscape Multibody.
More specifically, the files contained include: pneumatic circuit model, throwing mechanism model, and a pneumatic system model with a PID controller.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THE MODELS:

These models show how to build a throwing mechanism such that a ball can be targeted to a certain goal. Simscape and Simscape Multibody has been used to build the complete system and finally, PID controller has been used to control the trajectory of the ball.
All demos in this entry reinforce the concepts reviewed in the Modeling Pneumatic Robot Actuators series. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE MODELS:
## SETUP
Run initialize.m, and then go to the Examples folder.

## EXAMPLES
### 1_Simscape Pneumatic Circuit
Contains Simscape example of pneumatic circuit.

### 2_Simscape Multibody Throwing Mechanism
Contains Simscape Multibody of the throwing mechanism.

### 3_Pneumatic System with Controller
Contains pneumatic actuation system model with controller. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:

The models use the following MathWorks products, all from R2018b release:
1)MATLAB
2)Simulink
3)Simscape
4)Simscape Fluids
5)Simscape Multibody

## CONTACT FORCE, MULTIPHYSICS AND PARTS LIBRARIES
The models in this submission use following libraries:
1) Simscape Multibody Contact Force Library
2) Simscape Multibody Multiphysics Library
3) Simscape Multibody Parts Library

For convenience, local copies of these libraries have been included with this submission.

Alternatively, to install the latest version of these libraries, you can find
them from the Add-On Explorer, or on the File Exchange
